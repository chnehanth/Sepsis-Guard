# SepsisGuard: IoT-Enabled Real-Time Sepsis Alert System
SepsisGuard is a real-time healthcare monitoring system that uses IoT sensors and a machine learning model to detect early signs of sepsis. It ensures timely alerts to hospital staff via SMS and dashboards, helping prevent life-threatening complications.

# ðŸš€ Features
- Real-time monitoring of Heart Rate, Temperature, and Respiration 
- ML-based prediction using Random Forest
- Alerts via SMS and cloud dashboard (ThingSpeak)
- Cost-effective and scalable
- Easy-to-use Arduino-based setup

# ðŸ§° Technologies Used
- Arduino UNO, DS18B20, LM358
- Python, scikit-learn, pyserial
- ThingSpeak for IoT Cloud
- GSM Module for SMS alerts

# ðŸ§ª How it Works
1. IoT sensors collect real-time vitals.
2. Arduino transmits data via serial to a local system.
3. ML model analyzes vitals for sepsis risk.
4. If risk is high:
     - Alert sound (buzzer)
     - SMS alert to medical staff
     - ThingSpeak dashboard updates
